If there is something in the path of the garage door the safety sensors will not allow the garage door to close properly. Garage door wont close in the morning. The garage door may attempt to go down but will come right back up and the overhead light on the garage door opener will blink.</p>

<p>My Garage Door Opens Partially Then Stops Overhead Door Of The Inland Empire This also disables any remotes or wireless keypads. We purchased a garage door with keypad from Sears and have noticed that when the door itself is in the direct sunlight - late morning all the way until late afternoon you have to hold down the button on either the keypad or the button inside the garage by the door to the house until the garage door is all the way down - or else it will act like there is something in the way and start to close but then go. Garage door wont close in the morning. If its open and it wont close move onto the next step.</p>
