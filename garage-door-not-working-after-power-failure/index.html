<p>Help My Garage Door Is Uneven Or Sagging Creative Door However in almost every case its just a matter of raising the door pulling down on the rope and then pushing the control button on. The only other work that could be done at this point is to perform checks on the power connection to the board. The door must be completely closed in order to re-connect the garage door opener to it correctly. When your garage door opener is not responding to any command from the remote or the door control you need to check if the opener has electricity.</p>
