Sensors located at the bottom corners of door that keep door from closing when door opening is obstructed are lined up so they can see each other In all my years of repair service calls on openers the only time i have come across this problem is because bright early morning. If anything interrupts this beam of light the garage door will not close and the ceiling light on the opener mechanism will flash as mentioned in the previous step. It was worse for me because my garage door faces south and gets a lot of direct sunlight throughout the day. The problem is the infrared safety sensors which sit at the base of the tracks that prevent the door from closing when theres something in the door opening can get somewhat blinded if. Thats very helpful in finding out if theyre the reason your garage door wont close.</p>
